Supplementary Figure 1. Transgenerational effects of ancestral (F0) dietary alterations on relative trelahose concentrations in adult female flies. All data shown are relative to a control diet flies for each generation, where boxplots represent median and data quartiles and significance levels were corrected experiment wide using false discovery rate corrections [49] are represented by *** (0.001), ** (0.01), * (0.05). Note: significant statistical differences were calculated between controls and treatments using raw values for each generation, but are displayed as ratios relative to control means mean for that given generation in order to better show transgenerational trends.

Supplementary Figure 2. Transgenerational effects of ancestral (F0) dietary alterations on body composition in adult male flies. All data shown are relative to a control diet flies for each generation, where boxplots represent median and data quartiles and significance levels were corrected experiment wide using false discovery rate corrections [49] are represented by *** (0.001), ** (0.01), * (0.05). Note: significant statistical differences were calculated between controls and treatments using raw values for each generation, but are displayed as ratios relative to control means mean for that given generation in order to better show transgenerational trends. 

Supplementary Figure 3. Relationships between pilot and main studies. Pearsonâ€™s product-moment correlation coefficients were computed between the main and pilot study, where means were caluclated for each treatment, generation, and metabolite, and compared between the two studies. Significance levels are represented by *** (0.001), ** (0.01), * (0.05). 

Supplementary Table 1. Sex Specific Comparisons. Linear regressions were used to calculated residuals for the multivariate model, where fixed variables comprised of sex and total pooled fly weight for all metabolites within a given generation.

Supplementary Table 2. Treatment vs. Control Contrast Results. linear regressions were used to calculated residuals for the multivariate model, where fixed variables comprised of ancestral dietary treatment, sex, and total pooled fly weight for each endpoint (metabolite and fitness responses) within a given generation. Notably, given that standards were hand mixed for each generation, the absolute values of endpoint responses may not be comparable between generations. Thus, we compared treatments to controls within generations and display our data as relative differences between controls and treatments for each generation. Prior to analysis, linear model assumptions were validated. In order to account for Type I errors associated with multiple comparisons, False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections were conducted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedures.
