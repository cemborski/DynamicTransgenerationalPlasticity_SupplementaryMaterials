TITLE: Ancestral diet leads to dynamic transgenerational plasticity across five generations in Drosophila melanogaster

ABSTRACT:
Background: Ancestral exposures can influence phenotypic expression in subsequent generations, which influence diverse biological processes ranging from phenotypic plasticity to obesity. To date, most transgenerational studies work under the assumption of transgenerational response stability and reproducibility through time and across exposure differences, relying on short-term (i.e. 2-3 generations) single-exposure experiments. However, there is little evidence in the literature to validate this assumption, leaving the consistency and reliability of interpretations in question. Additionally, as most studies have focused on proximal mechanistic (‘how’) rather than ultimate evolutionary (‘why’) questions, the interpretations of observed responses and broader evolutionary implications remain unclear. In the current study, we begin to fill these gaps. Using the tractable model system Drosophila melanogaster, we employed a complex study design to analyze the transgenerational effects of three dietary sugar concentrations (i.e. no, low, and high) relative to controls on body composition (i.e. whole body fat and sugar concentrations) and reproduction (i.e. lifetime fitness) over five generations in both males and females. 

Results: We found that the changes in ancestral diet led to complex body composition and fitness fluctuations relative to control offspring responses across the five generations following exposure, despite the conformity of the treatments to a control diet in the F1-F5 generations. Interestingly, the direction of response frequently changed from generation to generation, and as a function of ancestral exposures and sex. These findings of fluctuating responses have not been documented previously, and were broadly consistent in both our pilot and main experiments. 

Conclusion:  In conclusion, our results highlight the dynamic and multifaceted nature of transgenerational plasticity. These findings do not match with commonly invoked explanations for the existence of transgenerational inheritance, and provide some of the first evidence that transgenerational response stability may not be universally valid. Additionally, they emphasize the need for more comprehensive, long-term, multifactorial study designs in order to better interpret the findings and understand the evolutionary implications of transgenerational inheritance.

NOTES:
The "data" file contains all metabolite and fitness data obtained during the main study. Notably, due to extraction procedure differences, different flies were used to measure sugar metabolites (i.e. glucose, trehalose, and glycogen) and fat metabolite (TAG, which are triglycerides). To normalize to fly weight, sugar.weight was used for sugar metabolites (as it represented the weight of the 4 pooled flies used to analyze sugars), and fat.weight was used for fat metabolites (as it represented the weight of the 4 pooled flies used to analyze fat).
