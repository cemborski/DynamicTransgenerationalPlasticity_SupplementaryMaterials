ANCESTRAL DIET LEADS TO DYNAMIC TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY OF METABOLITES & FITNESS ACROSS FIVE GENERATIONS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER

ABSTRACT:
Ancestral exposures can transgenerationally influence offspring phenotypic expression. Yet, the broader implications of transgenerational inheritance remain unclear, partly due to study design challenges. As most transgenerational studies focus on effects of a single extreme exposure over minimal transgenerational timeframes (i.e. 2-3 generations), the consistency of responses between varying exposure concentrations and the longer-term transgenerational inheritance trends are generally unknown. Using a complex experimental design, we analyzed the longer-term transgenerational effects of three varying dietary sugar concentrations on body composition and fitness relative to a control. Contrary to previous studies and expectations, we found significant fluctuations in phenotypic and reproductive responses across five generations following ancestral exposure, where the direction of offspring response changes across generations. We also found that the direction and strength of response differed depending upon the concentration of the stressor and the sex. Our results, which were broadly found in both our pilot and main experiments, are inconsistent with commonly invoked theories of transgenerational inheritance, highlighting the dynamic nature of transgenerational plasticity and the importance of more comprehensive study designs.


NOTES:
The "data" file contains all metabolite and fitness data obtained during this study. Notably, due to extraction procedure differences, different flies were used to measure sugar metabolites (i.e. glucose, trehalose, and glycogen) and fat metabolite (TAG, which are triglycerides). To normalize to fly weight, sugar.weight was used for sugar metabolites (as it represented the weight of the 4 pooled flies used to analyze sugars), and fat.weight was used for fat metabolites (as it represented the weight of the 4 pooled flies used to analyze fat).

The "Statistics.rmd" file contains the source code to all statistics conducted for this project. Notably, for each model within this .rmd file, the first letter corresponds to the measured variable (i.e. G = Glucose, T = Trehalose, Y = Glycogen, Ta = Triglycerides/TAG, F = Fitness). The second variable is a number, which corresponds to the generation (i.e. 0 = F0, 1 = F1...). The third variable corresponds to the sex (i.e. F = female, M = male). For example, G0F.Mod represents the Glucose, F0, Female model. Also of note, the plots were created with a different .rmd file; however the siginificance values shown on the plots reflect the calculations done from the "Statistics.rmd" file. Thus, although the plots show relative differences between controls and treatments in order to better show overall trends (i.e. where each sample is a percentage relative to the control mean for that given generation), significant statistical differences were calculated between controls and treatments using raw values, where all used calculations came from the Statistics.rmd file.

The Supplementary Tables folder contains all three supplementary tables for the main study, and the fourth supplementary table can be found in the pilot folder.
